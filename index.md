Short Bio: 

My name is Ashlee McKeon. 
I serve as an Officer and Research Psychologist in the U.S. Army. 
I am very data analysis driven in both my formal academic training and my employment duties and I am taking ST 558 as part of the Data Science Foundations (DSF) certificate program at NCSU.  
My intent is to go on to earn the full Master's degree in Computer Science, with a track in Data Science, after earning my DSF certificate. 
This blog will host all of my discussions for this semester's course.
